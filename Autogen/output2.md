To compare ChatGPT and Gemini, I will first gather information about both models, focusing on their capabilities, underlying technology, and intended use cases. I'll then analyze this information to highlight their similarities and differences.

### Step 1: Gather Information on ChatGPT

1. **Tool:** Use the available search tool to find details about ChatGPT, including its developer, technology, features, and applications.

### Step 2: Gather Information on Gemini

2. **Tool:** Use the available search tool to find details about Gemini, including its developer, technology, features, and applications.

### Step 3: Compare ChatGPT and Gemini

3. **Analysis:** Once the information on both models is gathered, compare their:
   - Developers and the technology they are based on.
   - Capabilities, such as text generation, understanding, and any multimodal capabilities.
   - Intended use cases and applications.
   - Performance metrics, if available.

### Step 4: Execute the Plan

Let's start by gathering information on ChatGPT and Gemini.

#### Information Gathering

1. **ChatGPT:**
   - Developed by OpenAI.
   - Based on the transformer architecture, specifically the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model.
   - Designed for generating human-like text based on the input it receives.
   - Applications include but are not limited to customer service, content creation, and conversational AI.

2. **Gemini:**
   - Developed by Google.
   - Also utilizes a transformer-based architecture, potentially with enhancements for multimodal processing.
   - Designed to process and generate text, potentially with stronger multimodal capabilities compared to ChatGPT.
   - Applications could range from conversational AI to more complex tasks involving multiple forms of input and output.

Let's execute the search tool to get the detailed information.
