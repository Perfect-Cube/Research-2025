It appears that the search_duckduckgo function is experiencing a rate limit error, which is preventing it from retrieving the necessary information. However, I can still provide a general response based on the available information.

To use drones with voice commands, you typically need a drone that supports voice control, either through a built-in feature or through an app that can be installed on a smartphone or tablet. Some drones use natural language processing (NLP) or specific voice commands to control the drone's movements.

Here are some general steps that might be involved in using a drone with voice commands:

1. Ensure the drone is compatible with voice control.
2. Download and install any necessary apps or software.
3. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to pair the drone with the device (e.g., smartphone) that will be used for voice control.
4. Learn the specific voice commands that the drone recognizes.

Some examples of voice-controlled drone technology include:
- Drones that can be controlled using virtual assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant.
- Apps that allow users to control drones using voice commands.

To gather more specific information, I would need to perform a successful search using the search_duckduckgo function.

Since the function calls were unsuccessful, I will provide a general answer.

## Using Drones with Voice Commands

To operate a drone using voice commands, you'll need a drone compatible with voice control technology, typically through a smart device or a dedicated voice-controlled system. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Requirements
1. **Compatible Drone**: Ensure your drone supports voice commands. Some popular models include those from DJI (e.g., DJI Mavic, DJI Spark) and Parrot.
2. **Smart Device**: You'll need a smartphone or tablet with the relevant drone control app installed.
3. **Voice Assistant**: Some drones work with voice assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa, either directly or through integration with the drone's app.

### Steps to Use Voice Commands
1. **Download and Install the Drone App**: Get the app associated with your drone from the App Store or Google Play.
2. **Connect Your Drone**: Follow the in-app instructions to connect your drone to your smart device. This often involves linking via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
3. **Enable Voice Control**: Check the app's settings for voice control options. Some drones have this feature enabled by default.
4. **Learn Voice Commands**: Familiarize yourself with the supported voice commands. Common commands include:
   - Takeoff/Land
   - Move Up/Down
   - Move Left/Right
   - Rotate Clockwise/Counterclockwise
   - Follow Me
   - Take a Photo/Video
5. **Operate the Drone**: Once connected and voice commands are enabled, you can start controlling your drone with voice.

### Popular Voice Command Features
- **Follow Me**: The drone follows you as you move.
- **Orbit**: Drone circles around a point of interest.
- **Return to Home**: Drone returns to its takeoff point.

### Considerations
- **Range and Interference**: Voice commands may not work well over long distances or in noisy environments.
- **Language Support**: Check if the drone's voice control supports your language.
- **Safety**: Always maintain line of sight with your drone and be aware of your surroundings.

### Example of Voice Commands for DJI Drones
| Command        | Action               |
|----------------|----------------------|
| "Takeoff"      | Drone takes off      |
| "Land"         | Drone lands          |
| "Up"           | Drone ascends        |
| "Down"         | Drone descends       |
| "Clockwise"    | Drone rotates right  |
| "Counterclockwise"| Drone rotates left  |

By following these steps and understanding the capabilities and limitations of your drone's voice command feature, you can enjoy a more hands-free and intuitive drone flying experience.
