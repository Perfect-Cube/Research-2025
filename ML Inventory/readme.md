# plan


i want to make a inventory management system , where parts stored in warehouse need to be delivered to showroom , each showroom has assembly line for example a , b , c . each line requires different parts and frequency of parts. showroom should have consistent inventory otherwise it pauses the line, different shifts like day shift or night shift consumes different number of parts each day, a showroom has multiple stations , each station has assembly line A ,B,C ,and consumes inventory

what we want to do is make a machine learning model that can predict, if the consumption is more then to prevent assembly line from halt it predicts and orders the parts from warehouse beforehand and doesnt halt any process.

so i want a synthetic data to train the model on and then predict required inventory refill

[Stage 1: Define Requirements & Entities]
-------------------------------------------------
| Identify Entities:                            |
|   - Warehouse                                 |
|   - Showrooms                                 |
|   - Stations                                  |
|   - Shifts                                    |
|   - Assembly Lines                            |
|   - Parts                                     |
| Define Consumption Patterns & Refill Triggers | 
-------------------------------------------------
            ↓

[Stage 2: Generate Synthetic Data]
----------------------------------------------
| Define Date Range and Shifts               |
| Simulate Random Consumption for Each       |
|    Assembly Line                           |
| Set Initial Stock & Threshold Levels       |
| Generate Records for Each Combination      |
|   (Showroom, Station, Part, etc.)          |
----------------------------------------------
            ↓

[Stage 3: Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering]
----------------------------------------------
| Handle Missing Values & Outliers           |
| One-Hot Encode Categorical Variables       |
| Create New Features (Daily Averages,       |
|   Consumption Rates)                       |
----------------------------------------------
            ↓

[Stage 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)]
----------------------------------------------
| Statistical Summaries & Distribution Plots |
| Correlation Analysis between Variables     |
| Identify Patterns in Shifts, Lines,        |
|   and Consumption                          |
----------------------------------------------
            ↓

[Stage 5: Model Development]
-------------------------------------------------
| Split Data into Training & Test Sets          | 
| Select Modeling Approach (RandomForest, LSTM) |
| Train Initial Model on Synthetic Data         |
-------------------------------------------------
            ↓

[Stage 6: Model Evaluation & Tuning]
------------------------------------------------
| Evaluate Performance (Confusion Matrix,      |
|   Classification Report)                     |
| Hyperparameter Tuning (Grid/Random Search)   |
| Cross-Validation for Robustness              |
------------------------------------------------
            ↓

[Stage 7: Prediction Pipeline]
------------------------------------------------
| Deploy Model for Real-Time Predictions       |
| Input New Consumption Data                   |
| Predict Refill Triggers & Required Inventory |
------------------------------------------------
            ↓

[Stage 8: Integration with Inventory & Order Management]
-------------------------------------------------
| Link Predictions with Order Management System |
| Trigger Automatic Reorder Process if          |
|   Threshold Met                               |
| Update Inventory Records Post-Delivery        |
-------------------------------------------------
            ↓

[Stage 9: Visualization & Dashboard]
--------------------------------------------------
| Create Real-Time Inventory Flow Charts         |
| Dashboard for Monitoring Consumption & Orders  |
| Alerts & Notifications for Low Inventory       |
--------------------------------------------------
