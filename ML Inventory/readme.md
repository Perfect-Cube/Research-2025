i want to make a inventory management system , where parts stored in warehouse need to be delivered to showroom , each showroom has assembly line for example a , b , c . each line requires different parts and frequency of parts. showroom should have consistent inventory otherwise it pauses the line, different shifts like day shift or night shift consumes different number of parts each day, a showroom has multiple stations , each station has assembly line A ,B,C ,and consumes inventory

what we want to do is make a machine learning model that can predict, if the consumption is more then to prevent assembly line from halt it predicts and orders the parts from warehouse beforehand and doesnt halt any process.

so i want a synthetic data to train the model on and then predict required inventory refill
