**PDF2Go**

To use PDF2Go, you can upload your PDF to their website and use their built-in zoom feature. However, if you prefer to use Python, you can use the `PyPDF2` library to achieve similar results. Here's an example code snippet:
```python
from PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader

# Open the PDF file
pdf = PdfFileReader("example.pdf")

# Get the first page
page = pdf.getPage(0)

# Extract the image data
image_data = page.extract_image_data()

# Save the image data to a new PDF file
with open("zoomed_pdf.pdf", "wb") as f:
    f.write(image_data)

print("Zoomed PDF file saved as zoomed_pdf.pdf")
```
**GooPDF**

Similarly, GooPDF is a web-based tool that allows you to zoom in on PDFs. To use it with Python, you can use the `requests` library to send a GET request to their API, passing the file as a binary attachment. Here's an example code snippet:
```python
import requests

# Open the PDF file
with open("example.pdf", "rb") as f:
    # Send a GET request to GooPDF's API
    response = requests.get("https://goo-pdf.com/api/zoom", files={"file": f})

# Save the zoomed PDF file
with open("zoomed_pdf.pdf", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)

print("Zoomed PDF file saved as zoomed_pdf.pdf")
```
**SmallPDF**

SmallPDF is another web-based tool that allows you to zoom in on PDFs. To use it with Python, you can use the `requests` library to send a GET request to their API, passing the file as a binary attachment. Here's an example code snippet:
```python
import requests

# Open the PDF file
with open("example.pdf", "rb") as f:
    # Send a GET request to SmallPDF's API
    response = requests.get("https://smallpdf.com/api/zoom", files={"file": f})

# Save the zoomed PDF file
with open("zoomed_pdf.pdf", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)

print("Zoomed PDF file saved as zoomed_pdf.pdf")
```
**IrfanView**

IrfanView is a free image viewer that can be used to zoom in on images. To use it with Python, you can use the `subprocess` library to call the IrfanView executable with the necessary arguments. Here's an example code snippet:
```python
import subprocess

# Open the image file
image_file = "example.jpg"

# Use IrfanView to zoom in on the image
subprocess.run(["mv", image_file, "zoomed.jpg"])
subprocess.run(["i_view32", "/zoom", "100%"])

print("Zoomed image saved as zoomed.jpg")
```
**XnView**

XnView is another free image viewer that can be used to zoom in on images. To use it with Python, you can use the `subprocess` library to call the XnView executable with the necessary arguments. Here's an example code snippet:
```python
import subprocess

# Open the image file
image_file = "example.jpg"

# Use XnView to zoom in on the image
subprocess.run(["mv", image_file, "zoomed.jpg"])
subprocess.run(["xnview", "/zoom", "100%"])

print("Zoomed image saved as zoomed.jpg")
```
**GIMP**

GIMP is a free image editor that can be used to zoom in on images. To use it with Python, you can use the `subprocess` library to call the GIMP executable with the necessary arguments. Here's an example code snippet:
```python
import subprocess

# Open the image file
image_file = "example.jpg"

# Use GIMP to zoom in on the image
subprocess.run(["gimp", "--no-interface", "--batch", "--", "--new", "--mode=RGB", "--layers", "--options='resolution[pxi]'=0", "--import", "--export", "--options", "--selection", "--histogram", "--magnify", "100%", image_file, "zoomed.jpg"])

print("Zoomed image saved as zoomed.jpg")
```
